# Redis with Python and Flask

This project demonstrates how to use Redis with Python and Flask, includes test cases for verifying functionality, and is set up to run in a Docker container.

## Features

- **Redis Integration**: Use Redis as a caching mechanism or data store with a Flask application.
- **Test Cases**: Includes unit tests for validating functionality.
- **Docker Support**: Provides a Dockerfile to build and run the application in a container.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: For creating the web application backend.
- **Redis**: For caching and data storage.
- **Python**: For server-side logic and integration with Redis.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application.
- **Testing**: Unit tests for ensuring code quality and functionality.

## How It Works

1. **Redis Integration**: Connect to a Redis server from the Flask application to store and retrieve data.
2. **Test Cases**: Use test cases to ensure that the application functions as expected.
3. **Docker Setup**: Build and run the application in a Docker container using the provided Dockerfile.
